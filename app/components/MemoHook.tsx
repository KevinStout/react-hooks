// The React useMemo hook returns a memoized value.

// Think of memoization as chaching a value so that it does not need to be recalculated.
// The useMemo hook only runs when one of its dependencies update.
// This can improve performance by reducing the number of times a function is called.
// The useMemo and useCallback hooks are similar. The difference is that useMemo returns a memoized value and useCallback returns a memoized function.
